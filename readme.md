<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About

<div style="text-align: justify">
  
**Motivation**: Academic project for Machine Learning Algorithms, M2AI. Choose a dataset to use Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning or Reinforcement Learning algorithms.

**Implementation**: All the code was implemented in python and it can be divided in three parts: **(1)** There's a web scrapper in src/scrapper.py that is responsible to extract all the houses currently available in one of the largest Portuguese houses market website. Each house has 22 features including the target feature (price). **(2)** There's a notebook in notebooks/house_price_eda.ipynb that is responsible for all the data exploration, data cleaning and data preparation. It also has the step where the model is trained from the filtered dataset. **(3)** There's a Flask python code which is responsible to open the web app and handle the requests from the user in order to ask the model for a prediction given the user house inputs as shown in the gif above.

**_Tested with_** Random Forest, XGBoost and CatBoost regression algorithms.

**_Built With_** Python3.6, sklearn and Flask.

<!-- SIMULATION -->

## Testing

```python
# install the requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt

# scrape the data
python src/scrapper.py

# create the regression based model
# run the notebooks/house_price_eda.ipynb notebook

# run the web app
FLASK_APP=src/app.py FLASK_ENV=development flask run --port 8085
```

## Contribution

Feel free to submit a pull request with your improvements for the web scraper/notebook.
